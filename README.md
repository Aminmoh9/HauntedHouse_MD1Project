# Haunted Mansion Adventure Game

Welcome to the **Haunted Mansion**! A text-based adventure game developed in Python where players must navigate through eerie rooms, solve riddles, and uncover secrets to escape the mansion.

## Game Overview
In this game, you find yourself trapped inside a haunted mansion. Your goal is to explore the rooms, solve riddles, collect keys, and escape before time runs out. The mansion is filled with mysterious objects, hidden clues, and challenging riddles that will help you unlock the main door and find your way out.

### Objective:
Your goal is to explore the mansion, solve the puzzles in each room, and escape before timer runs down.

## Key Features
- **Explore**: View all items available in a room. You will get descriptions of these items to help you make decisions.
- **Examine**: Examine a particular item by typing its name. Each item has its own description and potential use.
- **Pick**: If an item is collectable, you can pick it up. You can only carry one item at a time.
- **Move**: Navigate through the mansion by moving between interconnected rooms.
- **Quit**: Exit the game anytime by choosing this option.

## Rooms in the Haunted Mansion
- **Foyer**: The starting point of your adventure. The main door is locked, and you are trapped inside. The room is filled with eerie silence, cobwebs hanging from the ceiling, and dust floating in the air. A grand chandelier casts faint shadows on the walls. Multiple exits lead to other parts of the mansion.
- **Bedroom**: A dark, eerie room with an uncomfortable atmosphere.
- **Library**: A quiet, dusty room filled with old books and hidden knowledge.
- **Basement**: A creepy, dimly-lit room filled with cobwebs and secrets. Spooky surprises are waiting for you!
- **Kitchen**: A kitchen with strange sounds and hidden items.
- **Dining Room**: A grand dining area, but with a sinister presence.

## Requirements
- Python 3.x
- Libraries: `time`.

## Installation
1. Clone this repository or download the game files.
2. Run the game by executing the Python script `main.py`.

## How It Works
The game is built using **Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)** principles. It consists of several classes that model the various elements of the game, such as:
- **Rooms**: Represent different locations within the mansion (e.g., Foyer, Bedroom, Library, etc.).
- **Player**: Handles the player's actions, inventory, and interactions with the mansion, including challenges.
- **Items**: Objects in the mansion that the player can examine or pick up.

## Developer Notes
- This game uses basic text-based input and output to create a spooky and interactive experience.
- The game can be extended by adding more rooms, items, puzzles, and challenges.
